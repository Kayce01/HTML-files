            <p>Hello there! I'm Kayce Vergara, currently a BSIT 3C student. While I wouldn't say I'm a coding expert, I've found a certain joy in exploring HTML. Admittedly, I'm still in the early stages of learning, but I believe that with consistent practice and effort, I'll get the hang of it.</p>
            <p>Even though my coding skills are a work in progress, I've discovered a passion for HTML. It might seem challenging now, but I'm confident that the more I practice and put in the effort, the better I'll become.</p>
            <p>Beyond coding, I find myself immersed in indoor activities. Whether it's strategizing over a game of chess or diving into the virtual world of mobile legends, I thoroughly enjoy these moments of relaxation and fun.</p>
            <p>Apart from HTML, I've also dabbled in coding with MySQL. While I'm not yet an expert in this area, just like with HTML, I believe that continuous learning and practice will pave the way for improvement.</p>
            <p> I may be on the learning curve when it comes to coding, but I'm excited about the journey and the skills I'll gain along the way. Cheers to embracing the challenges and enjoying the process!</p>
