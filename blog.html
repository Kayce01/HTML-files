            <h3>Best interior design blog: Seasons in Colour</h3>
            <p>Jenny Kakoudakis interior design blog, Seasons in Colour, equips professional designers with educational contentâ€”all within a sophisticated, tasteful and user-friendly site. In fact, it earned an Amara Interior Blog Award back in 2016.
                The first fold of the site is a full-bleed image of the feature story. The secondary feature appears on a black background, which breaks up the design of the site while calling attention to an article that Jenny is particularly proud of. To monetize the blog, she built a shopping page full of affiliate links.</p>
